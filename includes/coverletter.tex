  % Introduction / Strengths
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  It is a pleasure to submit my cover letter and r\'{e}sum\'{e} for position IRC59421 in the Space Science \& Application Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
  With significant experience in \textsc{MCNP} and Python, including the modeling and simulating of detectors and their responses, I am ready to become an immediate and effective member of the ISR-1 team.
  %As a current employee of Los Alamos National Laboratory and collaborator in ISR-1, I am experienced in a wide range of the in the development and modeling of detectors using \textsc{MCNP} and Python, I am ready to serve the ISR-1 mission to help support
